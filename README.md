## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Reminders**:
- The program will directly move files, please backup important data before running
- The duplicate file finder will display paths and creation times of duplicate files but won't automatically delete them
- The year/month organizer will move files to a new directory structure
- The program automatically ignores system files like `.DS_Store`

## Supported File Formats

The program supports all file types:
- Image files: JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, etc.
- Video files: MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.
- Document files: PDF, DOC, TXT, etc.
- Audio files: MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.
- Archive files: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, etc.
- Any other file types

## Technical Details

- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses SHA-256 hash algorithm to calculate file content, ensuring accurate duplicate identification
- **File Organization**: Based on file modification time (mtime) for year/month classification
- **Recursive Scanning**: Automatically scans all subdirectories within the input directory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure you have read/write permissions for input and output directories
   - You may need to use `sudo` on macOS/Linux

2. **Path Does Not Exist**
